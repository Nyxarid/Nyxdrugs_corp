                    <p><strong>Nyxdrugs Corp.</strong> was founded by visionary C.E.O. Bartholomew Nyx after a profound moment of anti-clarity while waiting to buy milk. He watched people fueled by caffeine and ambition, rushing to be better, faster, stronger. "But to what end?" he whispered to a carton of eggs. "What if the real luxury isn't success, but a temporary and amusing distraction?"</p>
                    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                    <p>To synergize underwhelming experiences with premium branding, providing our customers with memorable moments of benign absurdity. We are committed to a vertically-integrated supply chain of ethically-sourced placebo effects and 100% biodegradable disappointment.</p>

                    <p>Our products are more legal than putting pineapple on pizza, and frankly, less offensive. They are composed entirely of common food ingredients.</p>
